<h3>
	The Dept. of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology is the administrative home to the Ph.D. program in Chemistry and Chemical Biology (CCB) which provides students with a broad and rigorous training in molecular thermodynamics, bioorganic chemistry, computational chemistry and structural biology.
</h3>
<p>
	 The program is distinctive in its orientation toward the study of molecules in living systems. It is further distinguished by providing integrated training in the sciences related to chemical biology: integrating both with respect to the levels of structure (atomic, molecular, cellular) and with respect to the traditional disciplines of chemistry and biology in the setting of a health science campus. The training objectives for students of the program are met through course work, laboratory rotations, and activities of the program such as journal clubs and research presentations and through thesis research in a specific laboratory. 48 Faculty are members of the program, so students have many choices for laboratories to conduct their Ph.D. thesis work.<br><br>CCB is a member of both the Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS) and the Program in Quantitative Biology (PQB), providing students with access to exceptional faculty and resources for biological research. CCB together with the Biophysics Graduate Program sponsors a joint seminar series entitled ""Linking Physics &amp; Chemistry to Biology" which meets once a week throughout the school year. The CCB program is jointly administered by the Depts. of Cellular &amp; Molecular Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.</p>
