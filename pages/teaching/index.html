<h3>Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Professional Teaching Program.</h3>

<p>
	Our Department sponsors pharmacology courses for pharmacy students at UCSF and collaborates in interdepartmental, integrated courses for medical and dental students. Some of these courses may be suitable for graduate students who need a survey of basic and clinical pharmacology and have a strong background in physiology and biochemistry. Two of our faculty; Dr. Marieke Kruidering-Hall and Dr. Susan Masters, are members of the <a href="http://medschool.ucsf.edu/academy/">UCSF Academy of Medical Educators </a>, an innovative organization dedicated to supporting and advancing the teaching mission of the UCSF School of Medicine and the people who carry it out. Dr. Masters also holds the Academy Chair in Pharmacology Education.
