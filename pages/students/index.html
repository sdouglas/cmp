				Graduate research training at UCSF in basic biological and biomedical sciences is organized interdepartmentally, primarily through two major research/training consortia: the Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS) and the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Graduate Program. Graduate study in these programs is aimed at students intending to earn a Ph.D.
