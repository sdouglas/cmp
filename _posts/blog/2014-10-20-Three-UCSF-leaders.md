The Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, was founded to support our nation's health by providing government and the private sector with expertise and evidence to make informed decisions. The IOM is comprised of leading scientists who volunteer their time and knowledge.


[Ron Vale's Lab](http://valelab.ucsf.edu/)
 Combines cell biological and biophysical approaches to understand spatial organization, movement, and signaling within cells. The lab integrates biochemical, structural, and microscopy-based approaches to study these questions at scales that span from atomic information of proteins to the behavior of cells in living organisms.
