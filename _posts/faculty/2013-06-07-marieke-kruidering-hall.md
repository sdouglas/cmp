My position at UCSF is dedicated full time to teaching and facilitation of teaching Pharmacology to students in the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry. I give lectures and am course director of courses in all three schools. The School of Medicine implements a significant amount of small group learning, which inspired a program that CMP runs together with the Department of Biochemistry, the Postdoctoral Teaching Fellowship. 

We oversee the recruitment of postdocs as small group leaders, provide training in small group teaching and give feedback after the teaching sessions. The program has been viewed as successful by the postdocs as well as medical students who were taught by the postdocs. (For more information see the link given above). Together with colleagues in the department of biochemistry, I collaborate on educational research on this program. Besides teaching basic pharmacology I keep up with my interest in apoptosis, by writing commentaries for BioMed net and drug discovery today.
