Dr. Brinen received a B.A. degree in chemistry from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, and a Ph.D. degree in chemistry from Cornell University. Her postdoctoral studies at UCSF were on structural studies of lung surfactant proteins and serine proteases. 

Dr. Brinen co-lead one section of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics, a NIH NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative Structural Genomics consortium at Stanford University/Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory before joining CMP at UCSF in June of 2003. Dr. Brinen is also the Director of Structural Biology at the UCSF Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases. 

Our research focuses on using structural biology, specifically X-ray crystallography, to ask and answer questions in biologically relevant systems. Of particular interest are proteolytic enzymes: the understanding of their function, the regulation of their activity and the structure-guided design of their specific inhibitors. Molecular level structures, particularly when used in concert with enzymological and cell- or animal model studies, provide a framework for advancing the specificity, efficacy and deliverability of potential therapeutic agents for the diseases in question. 

Infectious disease-based systems studied include Chagasâ€™ disease, also known as American Trypanosomiasis; African Trypanosomaisis, also known as Sleeping Sickness; Malaria; Toxoplasmosis; Fasciolosis, also known as liver fluke infection, and Amoebic Dysentery. A new area of study in the lab focuses on the roles of proteases in allergy-based systems and includes human dust mite allergy and human feline allergy. 

Molecular modeling experiments are often performed in advance of structure availability as these studies often yield significant insight into observed kinetic patterns and can be of use in designing expression constructs most suitable for crystallization. All structural biology projects in the laboratory benefits from the recent and ongoing developments in high-throughput structural biology technology. 

The Brinen lab endeavors to streamline the process from gene to three-dimensional structure by using portable high-throughput technologies in the home laboratory as well as making full use of community-available cutting edge technologies at both the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL/SLAC) and the Advanced Light Source (ALS/LBNL Berkeley).
