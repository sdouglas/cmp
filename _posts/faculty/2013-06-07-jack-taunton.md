Research in my laboratory follows two intersecting trajectories:
1. a cell biology trajectory, in which we pursue a biochemical dissection of the signals that control actin assembly and force generation on the surface of cellular membranes; and 
2. a chemistry trajectory, in which we synthesize small molecule tools to perturb and thereby illuminate cellular functions. 

We have used a structural bioinformatics approach to design ultra-specific protein kinase inhibitors. In addition, we have synthesized cotransin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide with potent anti-inflammatory activity. Biochemical and cell biological experiments have revealed its molecular target and mechanism of action.
