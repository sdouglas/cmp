### Nanoscale Construction with DNA

My research is on _foundational technology development_ and _demand-meeting applications_ of DNA nanotechnology.

In the _foundational_ category, I was lucky enough to work in <a target="_blank" href="http://research4.dfci.harvard.edu/shih/">William Shih</a>'s laboratory to contribute to papers on 3D self-assembly of DNA origami (’09 _Nature_ __459__:414–8) and a project led by <a target="_blank" href="http://bionano.physik.tu-muenchen.de/">Hendrik Dietz</a> to create twisted and curved DNA structures (’09 _Science_ __325__:725–30).

My first work in the _application_ category was in collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://chou.med.harvard.edu/">James Chou</a> at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Shih, Dr. Chou, and I developed DNA-origami nanotubes for partially aligning membrane proteins in solution to facilitate NMR structure determination (’07 _PNAS_ __104__:6644–8). To our knowledge, this was one of the earliest structural-biology applications of the DNA-origami method.

More recently, working as a postdoc at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, I collaborated with Dr. <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/1dbdYSG">Ido Bachelet</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/"> George Church</a>'s lab to create a prototype cancer-killing DNA nanodevice (Douglas, Bachelet & Church ’12 _Science_ __335__:831–4).

My most significant contribution thus far has been leading development of a computer-aided design software system called <a target="_blank" href="http://cadnano.org/" >cadnano</a> that enables rapid creation of DNA origami shapes and devices. The project has benefited greatly from <a target="_blank" href="http://cadnano.org/about">many contributors</a>.

Finally, with generous support from the Wyss Institute and inspiration from <a target="_blank" href="http://igem.org/">iGEM</a>, I also founded the <a target="_blank" href="http://biomod.net/">BIOMOD</a> competition in an effort to seed the growth of a larger community of young researchers in bionanotechnology. Again, this was done with the help of <a href="http://biomod.net/our-team">many people</a>.
